To serve and manage 14 000 Stotra text files cost‑effectively and scalably, you should:

1. Store the files in Firebase Storage
Why Firebase Storage?

It handles large volumes of static files (text, media) with built‑in CDN, secure access, and low cost per GB.

You avoid bundling these files into your APK/AAB (which would bloat the app).

How to organize in Storage:

sql
Copy
Edit
gs://<your‑bucket>/stotras/
├── Assamese/           ← primary languages (12 folders)
│   ├── stotra1.txt
│   ├── stotra2.txt
│   └── …
├── Bengali/
│   └── …
├── Devanagari/         ← main “source” for conversions
│   └── …
… (other 9 primary language folders) …
For the 39 non‑primary languages, you do not pre‑store those folders. Instead, at runtime you’ll convert from Devanagari source via Aksharamukha .

2. Index metadata in Firestore
You need a fast search index for 144 000 file names, with language tags, display names, and Storage paths. In Firestore create a collection stotras_index where each document holds:

js
Copy
Edit
{
  displayName: string,      // e.g. “Shiva Mahimna Stotra”
  transliteration: string,   // ITRANS or English name
  language: string,          // “Assamese”, “Devanagari”, etc.
  path: string,              // “stotras/Assamese/stotra123.txt”
  viewCount: number,         // for trending
  timestamp: Timestamp       // upload date
}
– This lets you run text queries (with range or fuzzy matching) without scanning Storage directly .

3. Uploading your 14 000 files
Prepare folders locally matching your Storage structure (12 folders with ~12000 files each).

Use the Firebase CLI or gsutil to batch‑upload:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Authenticate
firebase login
# Upload an entire folder
gsutil -m cp -r stotras/ gs://<your‑bucket>/stotras/
Generate Firestore index documents via a small script (Node.js or Python):

js
Copy
Edit
const admin = require('firebase-admin');
const bucket = admin.storage().bucket();
const files = await bucket.getFiles({ prefix: 'stotras/' });
files[0].forEach(file => {
  const [ , lang, name ] = file.name.split('/');
  db.collection('stotras_index').doc(name).set({
    displayName: name.replace('.txt',''),
    transliteration: /* your logic */,
    language: lang,
    path: file.name,
    viewCount: 0,
    timestamp: admin.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp()
  });
});
This populates your index so the app can search by name, language, etc.

4. App integration to fetch and display
In your Flutter app’s SearchPage you already query Firestore:

dart
Copy
Edit
final snap = await FirebaseFirestore.instance
  .collection('stotras_index')
  .where('displayName', isGreaterThanOrEqualTo: q)
  .where('displayName', isLessThan: q + '\uf8ff')
  .get();
Once the user taps a result, you navigate to ViewerPage with the document’s path 

. In ViewerPage:

dart
Copy
Edit
final path = widget.stotraDoc.data()['path'];
final data = await FirebaseStorage.instance.ref(path).getData();
final content = utf8.decode(data!);
Cache the file locally on first load to support offline favorites 

.

Bookmark read position and save in local storage (e.g. SharedPreferences).

5. Handling non‑primary languages
When a user’s contentLanguage is one of the 39 variants:

Your search index still pulls from stotras_index (which lists Devanagari source files).

On open, fetch the Devanagari text, then run it through your server‑side Aksharamukha conversion function (hosted as a Cloud Function).

Serve the converted Unicode back to the app.

This on‑demand conversion means you only store 12×12 000 files, not 51×12 000, saving storage costs 

.

In summary
Upload all 14 000 .txt files into 12 primary language folders in Firebase Storage.

Index every file in Firestore with path, name, language, etc.

Search Firestore for user queries (fuzzy, voice).

Fetch file content from Storage by path in your ViewerPage and cache locally.

Convert on‑the‑fly for non‑primary languages via Aksharamukha Cloud Function.

This approach ensures fast search, minimal app size, offline support, and cost‑effective storage.

where should i upload approx 5000 temples files(.md) state wise folders, and how should i implement in the app for user access?

To manage ~5 000 state‑wise Markdown temple files you should treat them just like the Stotra texts, but under a “Temples” hierarchy:

1. Upload all .md files into Firebase Storage
Structure your Storage bucket as:

perl
Copy
Edit
gs://<your‑bucket>/Temples/{State}/{TempleFile}.md
e.g.

bash
Copy
Edit
Temples/Andhrapradesh/srisailam.md  
Temples/Maharashtra/pandharpur.md  
… etc.  
This leverages Firebase’s CDN, security rules, and keeps your app bundle small. Storing .md in Storage works the same way as images or other blobs 
Stack Overflow
.

2. Index each temple in Firestore for fast lookup
Create a collection temples_index where each document represents one temple file, e.g.:

Field	Type	Example
displayName	string	“Srisailam Temple”
state	string	“Andhrapradesh”
path	string	“Temples/Andhrapradesh/srisailam.md”
keywords	array	[“srisailam”, “shiva”, “andhra”]
timestamp	Timestamp	time of upload

Firestore automatically builds single‑field indexes; this lets you run queries like:

dart
Copy
Edit
FirebaseFirestore.instance
  .collection('temples_index')
  .where('state', isEqualTo: selectedState)
  .where('displayName', isGreaterThanOrEqualTo: q)
  .where('displayName', isLessThan: q + '\uf8ff')
  .get();
to power your in‑app search with near‑instant results 
Firebase
.

3. In‑App Access Flow
Search Page

Query temples_index by state and name (with fuzzy/spelling‑tolerance).

Result Tap

You get the document’s path (e.g. Temples/Maharashtra/pandharpur.md).

Viewer Page

dart
Copy
Edit
final ref = FirebaseStorage.instance.ref(path);
final data = await ref.getData();              // download .md bytes
final markdown = utf8.decode(data!);           // decode to string
// render with flutter_markdown:
Markdown(data: markdown);
Local Cache

On first download, save the .md text to local storage (e.g. Hive or SharedPreferences) so subsequent opens and offline access are instant.

4. Security & Rules
Storage rule to allow reads but restrict writes to admins:

js
Copy
Edit
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /Temples/{state}/{file}.md {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth.token.role == 'admin';
    }
  }
}
Firestore rule to protect your index:

js
Copy
Edit
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{db}/documents {
    match /temples_index/{docId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth.token.role in ['admin','editor'];
    }
  }
}
5. Summary
Upload all 5 000 .md files under Temples/{State}/… in Firebase Storage 
Stack Overflow
.

Index them in Firestore temples_index with metadata for fast, fuzzy search 
Firebase
.

In app, query the index, fetch the Markdown blob by its Storage path, render it, and cache locally.

This pattern scales elegantly, keeps your app lightweight, and delivers instant, offline‑capable temple content.
